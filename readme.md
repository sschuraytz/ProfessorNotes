**Reflection by the Developers**
***
Creating our first major Android app has been a journey. We started out brainstorming for a
great idea. We wanted something practical – something that could be used in the real world.
We decided that professors interact with many students throughout the day, and could
benefit from a fast, straightforward way to keep track of information related to different
students. Thus, the idea of Professor Notes was born.
While working on Professor Notes, we really enjoyed the opportunity to implement a
range of Android features including fragments and RecyclerView, and SQLite database. 

**Future Enhancements**
***
  * Add New Student FAB
      * onClick Opens New Student View
  * Buttons:
      * Add Text Notes Area
      * Add Voice Note
      * Play Voice Note(s) (separate one for each note created with a description)
      * Optional More - Information Text Fields(Optional), would go right after 'Last Name' - e.g. School/Institution, grade/class   standing
